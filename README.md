### Hi, I'm Pinny! Welcome to my portfolio.  ðŸ‘‹

#### Here's a brief introduction about myself: 
I am a hard working "Data Practitioner" who loves to get my hand dirty with all the complex data that I can find. Being able to understand the data, process it, extract value from it, and come out with actionable insights, are what truly matters to me. I used to work as a Data Scientist for a Singaporean consulting company. Currently, I am working on my visualization and data story telling skills to get my Tableau Data Analyst Certificate and land a data-related job in Canada.
